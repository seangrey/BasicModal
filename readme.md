### Javascript Modal

This is a really simple modal made up in HTML and show/hidden using Javascript. It showcases the DOM (Document Object Model) and how you can manipulate Classes using Javascript.

- Class 'Hidden' is added/removed to show and hide both the modal window and overlay.
- Good examples of event listeners for both the 'click' events and key presses.

Special Thanks - This modal was originally taught in a Javascript Course on UDEMY - Jonas Schmedtmann.
